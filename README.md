## What? Why? How?

Cooperari is a tool for cooperative testing of multithreaded Java applications,

For further details refer 

This repository contains a completely revamped and refactored version of the original Cooperari implementation (archived [here](https://bitbucket.org/edrdo/cooperari/wiki/Home)), even if it follows the same general design principles are maintained. 

The major differences to the original versions are as follows:

* Yield point support improved and extended.
* The standard AspectJ runtime is used instead of the abc compiler.
Code is also instrumented using load-time aspect weaving rather than
offline weaving. 
* It now works with Java 8 instead thofan Java 7.

Cooperari is developed and maintained by [Eduardo R. B. Marques](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo).  The original version and design incorporated contributions from Miguel Sim√µes and [Francisco Martins](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~fmartins).

## Getting started

### Requirements

Cooperari requires Oracle's [Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
It may also work with OpenJDK 8, but it has not been fully tested in that
environment.

### Binary distribution 
Download one of the latest binary distribution packages here at [GitHub](link).

Extract the distribution package file and follow the instructions
in the provided `README.txt`.

### Maven Central

Cooperari artifacts will be available at Maven Central in future releases.

### Compiling from scratch

You may clone this repository to compile Cooperari from scratch. 
In addition to Oracle's JDK 8, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) 3.0 or higher will be required to compile Cooperari.

After cloning, execute `mvn package` in the `cooperari` directory.
This will compile all files, execute tests, and generate the Coooperari JAR and distribution files.
