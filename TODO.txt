== 0.2.1. final ==

Features left to implement:
- produce coverage files per JUnit test case
- update scripts to disable assertions in org.cooperari 
- cjava utility
- make cjunit invoke itself to move indirection
- operation arguments (yes/no? if yes at least written to trace)
- Revise Coverage/CoveragePolicy code
- CSystem.runPreemptively() 
- Windows scripts
- javadoc / source / deploy maven targets
- tools package organized differently (?)
- cjunit/cjava -p switch / ensure CJUnitRunner runs preemptively as well (maybe)
- @CKeepGoing (maybe)

Misc. implementation details
 -- Merge CRuntime / CSession ? Feature life-cycle revision.
 -- Get rid of Scheduler.wakeup() interaction
 -- operation arguments
 -- resource deadlocks / wait release step ?
 -- improve wait/notify tests + check tests being ignored
 -- CBlockingOperationResult used more often (sleep, join, ..., also)
 -- Inline yield points - refactoring
 -- feature package names ?
 -- serial ids for exception classes

Future workloads:
- Examples project
- Site organization.
