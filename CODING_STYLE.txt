== COOPERARI CODING STYLE ==

The source code of Cooperari closely follows the Google Java Style 
(http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) 
with the following variations and customzsations:

* Instance fields are named in camel-case fashion, but are also prefixed with an underscore ('_').
The aim is to prevent prevent shadowing declarations and to distinguish without ambiguity
instance fields from other definitions (e.g., local method variables) in any IDE/text editor,
 
* Definitions exposed through the org.cooperari package (the top-level main package used by client code)
are prefixed with 'C' -- classes, interfaces, enumerations, annotations, 
constants -- or 'c' -- static methods.
This prevents namespace pollution/clashing. 
The same scheme is used in definitions of sub-packages of org.cooperari
if namespace clashes are caused or likely to arise (e.g., CThread).
